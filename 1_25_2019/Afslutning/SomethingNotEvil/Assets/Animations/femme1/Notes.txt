There is an issue with the feet texture, As I haven't tried texturing this thing yet, I'm not sure which end is up on that texture.

I'm not an animator, so if anyone can animate this, please send me it afterwards ? :D

This is just an idea of how mmo's might do their texturing.

Thanks for any comments, and suggestions.
